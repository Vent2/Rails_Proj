# README

This applications database is SQL so to be up and running all you need to do is type rails s in terminal.
Afterwards you have a option of creating a new user or signing in an existing one. You can use FaceBook
to create and sign in to your account. From there you have the options to delete, edit user, look at all the raves created
or create your own. After creating a Rave you will be taken to this instance of a raves show page. There you will have the
same options as users page but can add a artist/DJ to your show page.
